              <p>I am a proud husband and father of three wonderful kids and I currently work in commercial real estate and starting in 2022 I began to teach myself front end development, starting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I found that coding and solving problems with computers is a newfound passion of mine and I would love an opportunity to learn new skills and pivot my career into the tech industry.</p>

                <summary><span>How I started my coding journey</span></summary>
                  <p>I got into coding before I really new what coding was. As a fairly avid gamer, I often found myself interested in hacking or modifying video games and was drawn to the idea of modifying or creating my own rules or limits within a game. I was especially thrilled when I started making modifications to a game and came across some of those moments when you expect a certain output and everything works as you intended. Often not before several rounds of failure which, I would later learn is a rite of passage for everyone in the coding/programming field. In 2022 I started looking at developer positions and realized there was an entire workforce built around coding and developing and realized I should've started this career years ago. As they say: better late than never. So here I am! In 2022 I started my journey to learn to code on my own because I knew there was something about coding and programming that has given me drive and ambition. Now my mission is to make this my career. I love learning, problem solving, thinking through ideas in different ways, and seeing results. So now I have realized something about myself - I long to be a developer.</p>
